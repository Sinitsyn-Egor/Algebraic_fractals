# Algebraic_fractals
Hi visitor.
The Mandelbrot set can be obtained from the formula Z_(n+1) = Z_(n)**2 + Z_0, Z_(1) = Z0. But what happens if you use other formulas? Since I had a little time in the summer, I wrote this, not all formulas can be used, but the code is open and simple, you can add what you need. Here are two examples that I got and like. Try to guess the formula.
